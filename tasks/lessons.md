# Lessons Learned

_Updated after every correction per workflow rules._

## Session 1 — Project Kickoff (2026-02-23)
- CORRECTION: This is a WEB APP (not mobile app) — mobile responsive, not mobile-first native. Do NOT generate mobile-only Stitch screens. Use DESKTOP device type for Stitch.

- Always read linked URLs and image instructions before planning
- Save workflow rules to memory immediately at project start
- Use Stitch for UI/UX inspiration before coding
- Follow the 6-rule workflow orchestration system religiously
